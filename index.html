          you’re not flexible, you’ll pound your head against the wall and you
          won’t see a different solution to a problem you’re trying to solve

            When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was
            the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted
            to be when I grew up. I wrote down ‘happy’. They told me I didn’t
            understand the assignment, and I told them they didn’t understand
            life.

            If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it
            would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel’s heartbeat,
            and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of
            silence. George Eliot

            I’ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300
            games. 26 times I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and
            missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And
            that is why I succeed.

          Everybody wants to be famous, but nobody wants to do the work. I live
          by that. You grind hard so you can play hard. At the end of the day,
          you put all the work in, and eventually it’ll pay off. It could be in
          a year, it could be in 30 years. Eventually, your hard work will pay
          off.
